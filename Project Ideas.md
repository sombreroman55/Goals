# PROGRAMMING PROJECT IDEAS

Most if not all of these are just cases of me reinventing the wheel as an exercise. Hopefully one day I'll have an original idea. Links to project repos will be added to the projects as they progress.

## Massive Projects [1+ year(s)]
* [ ] A toy implementation of an operating system
* [ ] Modal (bullet hell shooter pitch from Capstone) (time mainly as a result of making any kind of art assets)

## Big Projects [3+ months]
* [ ] Drum exercise generator for iOS in Swift
* [ ] Then do it again for Android in Java
* [ ] Text editor in Golang
* [ ] C to SNES assembly (65c816) compiler
* [ ] Remake Panello using Views in Swift rather than using OpenGL
* [ ] iOS SPC/video game music player app
* [ ] iOS module player (XMPlay for iPhone/iPad/mac)
* [ ] Shitty FLAC decoder/player
* [ ] Game Boy emulator
* [ ] Module player

## Medium Projects [3-8 weeks]
* [ ] Web crawler that updates and indexes solved programming challenges on various websites such as Kattis, Project Euler, UVa Online Judge, etc. Very similar to [this page](https://algo.is/solved-problems/).
* [ ] Tetris using SDL (or maybe SFML)
* [ ] Finish Panello with new assets
* [ ] GitHub random page selector + note taking program to explain what the page is doing in English to practice deciphering source code
* [ ] Old /g/ weekly programming thread challenges

## Small Projects [1-3 weeks]
* [ ] Implement the following data structures in C/C++:
	* [ ] Stack
	* [ ] Queue
	* [ ] Singly Linked List
	* [ ] Doubly Linked List
	* [ ] Doubly Linked List with only one pointer
	* [ ] Binary Tree
	* [ ] Binary Search Tree
	* [ ] Union-Find Disjoint Sets
	* [ ] Hash Table
	* [ ] AVL Tree
	* [ ] Red-Black Tree
	* [ ] Priority Queue/Heap
	* [ ] Segment Tree
	* [x] Trie (Used in several competitive programming problems/puzzles I've completed)
	* [ ] Suffix Array
	* [ ] Suffix Tree
	* [ ] Splay Tree
	* [ ] B Tree
	* [ ] Quadtree
* [ ] Finish Panello with old assets
* [ ] Get some dumb toy program using SDL working to learn how to get a larger SDL program off the ground
* [ ] Chrome extension to block access to websites after a certain amount of time is spent on them
* [ ] To add on to the last idea, an app the filters out any kind of ASMR video recommendation on YouTube
* [ ] Vaporwave vim colorscheme
* [ ] GitHub random page selector
* [ ] UVa CLI submission program
