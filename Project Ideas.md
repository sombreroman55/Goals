#PROGRAMMING PROJECT IDEAS

##Massive Projects [1+ year(s)]
* [ ] A toy implementation of an operating system
* [ ] Modal (bullet hell shooter pitch from Capstone) (time mainly as a result of making any kind of art assets)

##Big Projects [3+ months]

* [ ] Remake Panello using Views in Swift rather than using OpenGL
* [ ] iOS SPC/video game music player app
* [ ] iOS module player (XMPlay for iPhone/iPad/mac)
* [ ] Shitty FLAC decoder/player

##Medium Projects [3-8 weeks]
* [ ] Web crawler that updates and indexes solved programming challenges on various websites such as Kattis, Project Euler, UVa Online Judge, etc. Very similar to [this page](https://algo.is/solved-problems/).
* [ ] Tetris using SDL (or maybe SFML)
* [ ] Finish Panello with new assets
* [ ] GitHub random page selector + note taking program to explain what the page is doing in English to practice deciphering source code

##Small Projects [1-3 weeks]
* [ ] Implement the following data structures in C/C++:
	* [ ] Stack
	* [ ] Queue

* [ ] Finish Panello with old assets
* [ ] Get some dumb toy program using SDL working to learn how to get a larger SDL program off the ground
