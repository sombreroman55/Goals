# Goals for 2018



## Abstract
The goal of this document is to help define and track my goals for 2018, primarily when it comes to programming and engineering. Hopefully hosting such a document on Github where others can see it will help inspire me to work diligently on these goals and proudly show off any progress that is made.

It hopefully will also serve well for keeping track of other goals like reading non-technical fiction and non-fiction books, as well as hosting the files that can show off what I've made.

## The Plan
As computer science and engineering is such a vast field, that fact as well as many years of personal experience have taught that working on 100 things at once leads to ~1% progress on 100 fronts. So the plan here is to reduce my focus to 1-3 things at a time at the most and make 100% progress on those fronts before moving on to something else.

More specifically, I'd like to split the focus across several **key areas**, which for me at the moment consist of **Languages**, **Topics**, and **Projects**. **Languages** is the study of a programming language, learning its syntax and how to express my code ideas in that language. **Topics** are various CS topics of which I want a deeper knowledge. Examples might include algorithms, data structures, databases, operating systems, graphics, etc. **Projects** is rather self-explanatory, but having projects ranging from toy to medium-large-ish in size are good for creating a code portfolio to show to any and all potential employers, which leads me to the true goal of all this: 

#GET A JOB THIS YEAR!
