# Goals for 2018

## Abstract
The goal of this document is to help define and track my goals for the current year, primarily when it comes to programming and engineering. Hopefully hosting such a document on Github where others can see it will help inspire me to work diligently on these goals and proudly show off any progress that is made.

It hopefully will also serve well for keeping track of other goals like reading non-technical fiction and non-fiction books, as well as hosting the files that can show off what I've made.

## The Plan
As computer science and engineering is such a vast field, that fact as well as many years of personal experience have taught that working on 100 things at once leads to ~1% progress on 100 fronts. So the plan here is to reduce my focus to 1-3 things at a time at the most and make 100% progress on those fronts before moving on to something else.

More specifically, I'd like to split the focus across several **key areas**, which for me at the moment consist of **Languages**, **Topics**, and **Projects**. **Languages** is the study of a programming language, learning its syntax and how to express my code ideas in that language. **Topics** are various CS topics of which I want a deeper knowledge. Examples might include algorithms, data structures, databases, operating systems, graphics, etc. **Projects** is rather self-explanatory, but having projects ranging from toy to medium-large-ish to extra large in size is a good way to apply what I have learned in the other two sections of my study in an interesting way, leaving the realm of theory and entering the realm of practicality.

## Current Studies

| Key Area  | Focus | Book/Course |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Languages | C/C++ | The C Programming Language; The C++ Programming Language|
| Topics	| Data Structures/Algorithms | Introduction to Algorithms; Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ |
| Projects  | See projects list | Google; N/A |

## Languages Reading List
As there are a great many languages I would like to learn and each language has a great deal of literature devoted to it, this list seeks to enumerate a portion of those books and their related languages that I hope to someday read. The book(s) in the current studies section will reflect those books and languages from this list that are currently being studied. My aim is to keep these sections current, even though probably no one else but myself is monitoring this page.

- [ ] The C Programming Language
- [ ] The C++ Programming Language

## Topics Reading List
As with the **Languages** section, this section is dedicated to the reading list of the topics I would like to learn from computer science (at probably sometime soon in the future math as well). This list will probably be much longer than the previous list since there is a wealth of topics, each of which with seemingly endless depth, that I would like to learn. While I realize that it is unobtainable and foolhardy, my goal is to understand everything about computers. This page, these lists, and these goals are manifestations of that desire, and even if I never know *everything*, I still want to know everything that I can.

- [ ] Introduction to Algorithms
- [ ] Data Structures and Algorithms in C++
- [ ] Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective

## Other Reading List
If you can believe it I also enjoy reading things *not* related computer science or math. This list is a list of books I'd like to read for fun. Some of them have been on my mental "To Read" list for years.

- [ ] The Complete Fiction - H.P. Lovecraft
- [x] The Count of Monte Cristo - Alexandre Dumas
- [ ] The Worm Ouroboros - E. R. Eddison
- [ ] Moby Dick - Herman Melville
- [ ] The Complete Works of Willaim Shakespeare - William Shakespeare
- [ ] The Holy Bible
